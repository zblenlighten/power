    - Serialization: from data structures in memory to self-contained sequence of bytes (e.g. JSON document) write to file or send over network (vs: Parsing / Deserialization) ([Java: serialization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialization-in-java/), [Python: pickle](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/1016959663602400/1017624706151424))
    - Binary schema driven formats
  - Scenarios
    - Database: sending a message to your future self
    - Service calls (RPC vs REST API)
    - Asynchronous message passing (via message broker or actor)

- Messaging (Message-oriented middleware)

    - Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) / Java Message Service (JMS) style message broker
    - Log based message broker
  - Message queue: decoupling (e.g. RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, ActiveMQ)
  - Kafka
    - Use cases (data intensive scenarios): messaging, activity tracking, metrics gathering, log aggregation, stream processing, decoupling of system dependencies
    - Topics - Partitions - Offsets
      - Bootstrap server (connection + metadata request)
      - Topic partitioning: What if a topic gets too big for one computer or one computer is not reliable
    - Core APIs
      - Producer
        - acks: 0, 1, all
        - Keys: key to partition hashing (vs: round robin)
        - Example: RTSP (Real time streaming protocol) producer
      - Consumer
        - read data from a topic in order within each partitions (subscribe vs assign to a partition and seek to offsets)
        - Consumer groups (same group read from mutually exclusive partitions)
          - lag = log end offset - current offset
          - reset offset

      - Operator: action, transfer, sensor
      - Executor: Sequential, Local, Celery, K8s (get the tasks to run from its internal queue and specify how to execute it)
        - Celery: tasks queues to distribute work across threads or machines

        - data duplication and missing columns are common
    - HBase
  - Graph database
    - Neo4j
      - Graph: hierarchical or nonhierarchical, number of nodes and edged, the longest distance between nodes
      - Nodes (entity) - Properties (columns in a relational database table)
      - Edges (relationship): directed or undirected, symmetric or asymmetric
      - Tips
        - Traverse paths instead of joins
        - Identify important nodes

    - High latency (not appropriate for OLTP), no transactions, no record (because under the hood there are no real database)
  - HBase ([Bigtable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigtable))
    - ZooKeeper
    - Access ways: HBase shell, Java API, Spark, Hive, Pig, Rest API, Thrift, Avro

- Cache
  - Types
    - Application server cache: placing a cache on request layer node enables the local storage of response data
    - Distribute cache: each of its nodes own part of cached data, the cache is divided up using a consistent hashing function
    - Global cache: all nodes use the same single cache space
    - Content delivery network (**CDN**): first request ask the CDN for data, if not, CDN will query the backend servers
      - Fastly, Cloudflare vs Amazon CloudFront
      - Static page vs Dynamic page (CGI)
      - [CDN工作原理及其在淘宝图片业务中的应用](https://blog.csdn.net/taobaojishu/article/details/110458820)
  - Client-side cache: Varnish
  - Cache coherence / invalidation
    - Writing policies
      - Write-through cache: data is written to cache & DB at the same time, this minimizes the risk of data loss, but higher latency for write 
      - Write-around cache: data is written directly to DB, this reduces flooded write operations, but creates a cache miss
      - Write-back cache: data is written to cache alone, this results in low latency & high throughput, but comes with the risk of data loss in case of crash

  - Testing
    - Throughput = # tasks / time
      - hps, tps, qps: number of HTTP requests/Transactions/Queries per second
    - Latency = time / task
    - Number of concurrent sessions/users (Concurrency = throughput * latency)
    - Internal metrics: CPU (interrupts per second), Memory, Network (bandwidth, connection state), Disk I/O, etc.
  - Optimization
    - Global Data Center (multi-data center architecture)
    - Hardware
    - Operating system (Linux: transparent huge page)
    - JVM
    - Infrastructure: web container, database connection pooling, MVC framework
    - Architecture: cache (read-through vs cache-aside), message broker, clustered architecture
    - Programming: algorithms, data structure, design pattern, asynchronous I/O

- Availability
  - **If the system goes down**: resiliency (SPOF: single point of failure), availability, stability
  - Redundancy backup: Load balancing, database with multi master replication
  - Fault and latency tolerance: Hystrix, message broker
  - Flow control & degrade
  - Global server load balancing (GSLB)

- The Architecture Process
  - Understand the System’s Requirements
  - Understand the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR, SLA: Service-level agreement)
  - Map the Components (logic diagram, technical diagram, physical diagram)
  - Select the Technology Stack
  - Design the Architecture
  - Write Architecture Document
  - Support the Team

- Edge Computing
  - Network architectural pattern for compute and storage
    - Networking + Storage + Compute + Management
    - Edge computing leverages federated architectures
  - Components
    - Sensor/Data input
    - Edge device/Computer: processor, solid-state storage (SSD), network interfaces (5G, wifi, bluetooth, etc.), operating system, machine learning (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
    - Cloud-based Central Computer: databases (e.g. AWS IoT)
  - Considerations
    - Security: sensors, device, backend cloud based systems
    - Governance (integrated with all security): use of services, policies
    - Management (device side - cloud side): long-term operation, updates, hardware, network
    - Data management: storage, metadata, security, business continuity, disaster recovery, change management
    - Operations: monitor, consistent, automate, visibility/access/identity
    - AI and machine learning

- Cases
  1. Web crawler
      - BFS & DFS (Overhead time) by Scheduler (Priority queue stores URLs that have been discovered but not yet downloaded)
      - Page analysis and URL extraction (parsing Javascript)
      - URL table (In the case of thousands of servers: 明确每台下载服务器的分工，向散列表发送询问判断URL是否下载)

  2. URL shortening
      - Distributed ID Generator
      - Key-value store
      - URL redirection (302)

  3. Messenger service (feature → architecture)
      - One to one text
      - Sent / Delivered / Read
      - Push notification

### Practice

- WBS (Work breakdown structure)
  - Problem statements: RfQ (Request for quotation), SoW (Statement of work)
  - PoC (Proof of concept)
  - **User story** & Feature list
    - An end user going through a domain-level process to achieve some valuable outcome
    - Who, What, Why, Acceptance Criteria (AC)
  - Architecture design
  - Coding, testing, release
  - Maintenance & Iterative and incremental development

- Development Approach
  - TDD (Test driven): state desired outcome as a test
  - BDD (Behavior driven): base tests on natural language descriptions of business functionality
  - FDD (Feature driven)
  - DDD (Domain driven)
    - Bounded Context
    - Reactive model (publish subscribe model, vs: Declarative model)
      - Entities communication
      - Message broker
    - Event storming: design a system that models the structure and flow of activities within the business itself

- Code Review
  - Programming style
  - Code review best practice
    - [what to look for](https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/tag/what-to-look-for/)
    - Human reviewers should be doing what cannot be automated (automate everything you can)
    - Understand the constraints
    - Knowledge sharing (focus on how to understand the code easily)
    - Gateway type code review: should have a list of specific checks (not right time for: design patterns, SOLID, reusability)
    - Reviews should be small
    - Reviewing respond in a timely fashion
    - Comments with Why, When and What
