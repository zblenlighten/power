### Network

- Microservice architecture
  - Reverse proxy (load balancing, caching, access blocking, etc.)
    - API Gateway
- TCP/IP
- Gateway (routing)
- HTTP status
  - 2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood and accepted
  - 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
  - 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
  - 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
